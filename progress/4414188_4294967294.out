When the sky turned dark and serene,

Silver stars started to shine their light,

As they danced through the velvet night.

Under the moon's warm glow,

Animals and humans whispered,

Nighttime secrets in our ears,

Telling tales with growing fears.

A gentle breeze flowed through leaves,

Kissing them goodnight as they swayed,

And the earth seemed to breathe again,

Releasing her last sigh for the day.

Woodland creatures stretched and yawned,

Finding their spots on the ground,

Waiting, watching, and listening,

For the heartbeat of the world to sound.

Under our windowsills and under our beds,

Moths and fireflies led their own parade,

Illuminating the darkness with joy,

As we whispered our wishes and prayers.

From this day on,

May our nights be filled with peace and

Our days be bl
